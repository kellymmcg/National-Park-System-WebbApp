GNP	Glacier National Park	Montana	1013322	6646	745.6	923	Temperate	1910	2338528	Far away in northwestern Montana, hidden from view by clustering mountain peaks, lies an unmapped corner—the Crown of the Continent.	George Bird Grinnell	Glacier might very well be the most beautiful of America's national parks. John Muir called it "the best care-killing scenery on the continent." The mountains are steep, snowcapped, and punctuated by stunning mountain lakes and creeks. Much of the land remains wild and pristine, a result of its remote location and the lack of visitation in the 19th century.  	$12	300
GCNP	Grand Canyon National Park	Arizona	1217262	8000	115	120	Desert	1919	4756771	It is the one great wonders. . . every American should see.	Theodore Roosevelt	If there is any place on Earth that puts into perspective the grandiosity of Mother Nature, it is the Grand Canyon. The natural wonder, located in northern Arizona, is a window into the region's geological and Native American past. As one of the country's first national parks, the Grand Canyon has long been considered a U.S. treasure, and continues to inspire scientific study and puzzlement.	$8	450
GTNP	Grand Teton National Park	Wyoming	310000	6800	200	1206	Temperate	1929	2791392	We can not have freedom without wilderness.	Edward Abbey	The peaks of the Teton Range, regal and imposing as they stand nearly 7,000 feet above the valley floor, make one of the boldest geologic statements in the Rockies. Unencumbered by foothills, they rise through steep coniferous forest into alpine meadows strewn with wildflowers, past blue and white glaciers to naked granite pinnacles. The Grand, Middle, and South Tetons form the heart of the range. But their neighbors, especially Mount Owen, Teewinot Mountain, and Mount Moran, are no less spectacular.	$15	380
MRNP	Mount Rainier National Park	Washington	236381	5500	260	573	Rainforest	1899	1038229	Of all the fire mountains which like beacons, once blazed along the Pacific Coast, Mount Rainier is the noblest.	Unknown	Mt. Rainier National Park is one of three national parks in the state of Washington and is one of America's oldest parks, being one of only five founded in the 19th century. The park was created to preserve one of America's most spectacular scenic wonders, the snow-capped volcano known as Tahcoma to Indians in ages past and as Mt. Rainier now. While the mountain is unquestionably the centerpiece of the park, its 235,612 acres (378 square miles) also contain mountain ranges, elaborate glaciers, rivers, deep forests, lush meadows covered with wildflowers during the summer, and over 300 miles of trails. 96% of the park is classified as wilderness.	$20	280
GSMNP	Great Smoky Mountains National Park	Tennessee	522419	6500	850	939	Temperate	1934	10099276	May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most amazing view. May your mountains rise into and above the clouds.	Edward Abbey	The Great Smoky Mountains are a mountain range rising along the Tennessee–North Carolina border in the southeastern United States. They are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains, and form part of the Blue Ridge Physiographic Province. The range is sometimes called the Smoky Mountains and the name is commonly shortened to the Smokies. The Great Smokies are best known as the home of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which protects most of the range. The park was established in 1934, and, with over 9 million visits per year, it is the most-visited national park in the United States	$0	400
ENP	Everglades National Park	Florida	1508538	0	35	0	Tropical	1934	1110901	There are no other Everglades in the world. They are, they have always been, one of the unique regions of the earth; remote, never wholly known. Nothing anywhere else is like them.	Marjory Stoneman Douglas	The Florida Everglades, located in southern Florida, is one of the largest wetlands in the world. Several hundred years ago, this wetlands was a major part of a 5,184,000 acre watershed that covered almost a third of the entire state of Florida. The Everglades consist of a shallow sheet of fresh water that rolls slowly over the lowlands and through billions of blades of sawgrass. As water moves through the Everglades, it causes the sawgrass to ripple like green waves; this is why the Everglades received the nickname "River of Grass."	$8.00	760
YNP	Yellowstone National Park	Wyoming	2219791	8000	900	1900	Temperate	1872	3394326	Yellowstone Park is no more representative of America than is Disneyland.	John Steinbeck	Yellowstone National Park is a protected area showcasing significant geological phenomena and processes. It is also a unique manifestation of geothermal forces, natural beauty, and wild ecosystems where rare and endangered species thrive. As the site of one of the few remaining intact large ecosystems in the northern temperate zone of earth, Yellowstone’s ecological communities provide unparalleled opportunities for conservation, study, and enjoyment of large-scale wildland ecosystem processes.	$15	390
YNP2	Yosemite National Park	California	747956	5000	800	1720	Forest	1890	3882642	Yosemite Valley, to me, is always a sunrise, a glitter of green and golden wonder in a vast edifice of stone and space.	Ansel Adams	Yosemite National Park vividly illustrates the effects of glacial erosion of granitic bedrock, creating geologic features that are unique in the world. Repeated glaciations over millions of years have resulted in a concentration of distinctive landscape features, including soaring cliffs, domes, and free-falling waterfalls. There is exceptional glaciated topography, including the spectacular Yosemite Valley, a 914-meter (1/2 mile) deep, glacier-carved cleft with massive sheer granite walls. These geologic features provide a scenic backdrop for mountain meadows and giant sequoia groves, resulting in a diverse landscape of exceptional natural and scenic beauty.	$15	420
CVNP	Cuyahoga Valley National Park	Ohio	32832	696	125	0	Woodland	2000	2189849	Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt.	John Muir	Though a short distance from the urban areas of Cleveland and Akron, Cuyahoga Valley National Park seems worlds away. The park is a refuge for native plants and wildlife, and provides routes of discovery for visitors. The winding Cuyahoga River gives way to deep forests, rolling hills, and open farmlands. Walk or ride the Towpath Trail to follow the historic route of the Ohio & Erie Canal	$0	390
RMNP	Rocky Mountain National Park	Colorado	265761	7800	300	660	Woodland	1915	3176941	It's not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves.	Sir Edmund Hillary	Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the highest national parks in the nation, with elevations from 7,860 feet to 14,259 feet. Sixty mountain peaks over 12,000 feet high result in world-renowned scenery. The Continental Divide runs north - south through the park, and marks a climatic division. Ancient glaciers carved the topography into an amazing range of ecological zones. What you see within short distances at Rocky is similar to the wider landscape changes seen on a drive from Denver to northern Alaska.	$20	360
